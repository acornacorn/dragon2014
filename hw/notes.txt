Hardware:

Eye LED pins:
1 (black) = +4.5v
2         = red cathode
3         = green cathode
4         = blue cathode

Each eye has 2 LEDs.  Each LED color has a resistor:
red: 180ohm
g,b: 200ohm

Can work with 4.5
Works with 6 volts PWM only (<100% duty cycle).  (Red will have 12mA at 6v or
24mA at 6.6v which is over spec and can burn it out.)
